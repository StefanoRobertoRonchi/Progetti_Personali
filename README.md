# Personal Projects

In this repo it's currently possible to get python scripts regarding the implementation of:

- **Chow-Lin Time Series Decomposition (1973)**: technique useful to augment the granularity of a time series exploiting the correlations between the target low frequency TS and a higher granular one.
  - **Simple Unobservable Componenet Model**: model useful to disaggregate GDP into a trend (i.e., long term) and cycle component.
  - **Bayesian Variable Selection methods via gibbs sample**: implementation of a Bayesian Selection Algorithm, described by McCulloch (1993), alternative to classical step-wise criteria used for OLS estimated models.
 
All the codes are for Python and are developed from Matlab codes provided in the course Bayesian Methods for Economics and Finance (SidE).
