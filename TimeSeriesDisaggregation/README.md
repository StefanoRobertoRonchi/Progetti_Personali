The folder **TimeSeriesDisaggregation** contains the implementation in Python of the Chow Lin Time Series Disaggregation Method with the feasible GLS and MLE (**next release**) estimation method. The codes have the purpose to show the econometric and algorithm steps of the underlying procedure. The feasible GLS technique has been introduced in *Best Linear Unbiased interpolation, distribution, and extrapolation of time series by related series* (Chow,Lin, 1971)
  
For practical applications, such as forecasting production, there is the `timedisagg` package in Python which is a translation from the original package developed in R and includes several estimation methods which deal with non-stationary behavior.
