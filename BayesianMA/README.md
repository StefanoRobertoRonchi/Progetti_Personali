In the following section is reported the Python implementation of the Stochastic Search Variable Selection (SSVS) described in  _Variable Selection by Gibbs Sampling_ (Robert McCulloch & Edward George,1993).

The model,implemented via Python is the following:

$$
y = X\beta + \varepsilon, \qquad \varepsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2 I_n).
$$
